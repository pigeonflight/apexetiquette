# Chat Etiquette

Honestly, this should just say "don't be a jerk," but since many players seem to lack a basic understanding of what that requires:

* Don't curse in anger at your teammates.
* Don't blame your teammates for your failures.
* Don't harass your teammates in any manner.
* Don't tell your teammates that they suck.
* Don't be unnecessarily loud (we don't want to hear your music or if your house is excessively loud, selectively mute please so your team can hear the game).
* Don't talk too much (it's fun to chat, but make sure you are not monopolizing the audio or serving just to annoy and distract your squad).
